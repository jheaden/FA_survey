# FA_survey
Survey with very complicated scoring

35 questions sorted into 12 categories (2 to 4 questions in each category, variable)
Each question has the same 8 answer options
Each question has a different threshold at which the user's response becomes "clinically significant."
Any clinically significant response to any question in a category triggers a "true" for the category
Final score is the number of categories with a "true" value
